Since finishing my sophomore year, I've finally had some time to sit down and
complete some projects that I've been meaning to work on for a long time. The
first of these was to rewrite my entire site using a web framework.

When I created this site, I wanted to ensure that it would be easy to extend
and maintain. I also wanted to minimize the amount of work I would have to do
to add things to it. I accomplished this by using a large amount of PHP and
JavaScript. However, there were still a lot of things that were bothering me
about the site. For example, nearly all of the HTML had to be hand written for
each new addition to the site. Worst of all, my layout was based around floats
and hacky percentages, which made it very difficult to maintain.

I've learned a lot about web development since I first wrote the code for this
site. I hated to look at all my old code when I knew that there existed
solutions for all of the problems that I was facing. And so, I began the site
redesign.

While I plan to expand upon the improvements to the sites in a series of future
blog posts, the full list of changes is as follows:

* Moved the backend from PHP to Python/Flask
* Rewrote all layout code to use the CSS3 flexible box model
* Moved blog from Wordpress to my own format

I'm definitely excited to be moving forward with the site. Thanks for reading,
and I'm looking forward to explaining my design decisions in future posts.
