Well, we're a ways through June and it's time for another blog post. I've had a
few things keeping me busy, mostly my job. I am a working at Washington
University doing research under a professor and a few graduate students. Most
of my work involves writing bash scripts to evaluate biological data. I feel
very at home in a command line and I enjoy learning new tools. It's a
challenge, but I'm having a lot of fun with it.

I updated the website a little bit. I'm always cleaning up the CSS and making
things look a bit nicer. The projects page has seen most of these updates.

I have also begun work on a new project, titled LearnALanguage. It's based on
the awesome JavaScript learning tool [Codecademy][codecademy] but intended for
Java. The project is daunting to say the least, but I've learned so much about
the intricacies of Java through this project. I'm planning to write a much more
in-depth post about the program when I first release it. It's coming along very
nicely: It's at the point where a user can enter a program, compile it, and run
it, all within a single window. The next step will be to add lessons, but
that's the fun part!
