    The Facebook Filesystem. FBFS is an alternative interface to Facebook
    where Friends, statuses, photos, etc. are represented as files or

    permissions and symbolic links are used to provide as smooth a
    user-experience as possible. The repository also contains a [research
    paper](https://github.com/euclio/fbfs/blob/master/paper/final_paper.pdf)
    describing the implementation in detail.

  description: >
    My work for the Pomona College Senior Exercise, as a part of earning my
    degree in Computer Science. I held a study where programmers attempted
    to implement a series of example programs in C++, D, and Rust. I studied
    the number and type of bugs that arose, and discussed how various
    language features assisted in preventing such bugs in [a
    paper](https://github.com/euclio/senior-project/blob/master/senior-project.pdf).
